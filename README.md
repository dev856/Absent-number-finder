# Simple python program to find the absent student numbers
This program will find the absent student numbers from the given files.
For that we have to give two CSV files as input.One CSV file contains the list of all student's numbers.Another CSV file contains the attendance list of any particular date.
This will be useful with the CSV attendance list. If you download the student's attendance in the form of CSV file then you are able to find absent numbers through this program.

filename variable contains that file which has list of all students. We have to provide this file one time.
filename1 variable contains file which has attendance of particular date. You have to provide this file when you want to find the absent numbers.
you have to give the name of file which you are going to provide.
you will recieve the output in the form of text file which contains all the absent numbers.


I will working on this and try to add some GUI.
